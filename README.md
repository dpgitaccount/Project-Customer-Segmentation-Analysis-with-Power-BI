# Project-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-with-Power-BI
This project segments customers based on their purchasing behavior to identify different target groups.This project aims to identify customer segments using various data points such as customer purchase_Frequency behavior, Education, Gender, customer income, customer age and customer spendings. By leveraging Power BI, we create dynamic visualizations that provide insights into customer segments, enabling businesses to better understand and target their audience, improve customer engagement, and enhance marketing strategies.

⇒ Project Objectives:-
To analyze customer data and identify meaningful segments using key variables.
To create interactive Power BI visualizations to explore and understand each segment’s characteristics.
To develop actionable insights for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.
To provide a streamlined, interactive dashboard for business stakeholders.

⇒ Data Source:-
The dataset used for this project includes customer Name, Income,Purchase_Frequency,Education, Country, Age, Gender and other behavioral indicators. 
The data typically contains fields like:-
Customer Name
Age, gender, location, income 
Purchase frequency and transaction amounts
